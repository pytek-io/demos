Display historic performances of crypto derivatives fetched from [derebit](https://www.deribit.com) realtime API. It displays various information on two stacked graphs allowing four different axis to be used. Note the multiple dependant dropdown menus are automatically (re)populated from top to bottom with the relevant entries which allows for an easy selection. This application also has another slightly more advanced UI which uses [AG-Grid](internal:website.reflect.libraries/ag-grid.md) and [rc-dock](internal:website.reflect.libraries/rc-dock.md) which can be launched [here](demos.crypto_backtester.dashboard).
