Create todo lists that can be edited. This demo closely replicates the look and feel of this pure JavaScript [example](https://github.com/leonardopliski/react-antd-todo), but provides more advanced functionality such as auto-save, items ordering, smart tab name.

### Key features

- Add file name to the application hash for nicer user experience, allowing to bookmark lists or navigate between them seamlessly

- Use a `Mapping` to generate item representations. This is an optimization that would be useful if there was a large number of items or if their representation required a significant amount of data (eg: image, tables, charts, etc)
