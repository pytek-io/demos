- - Who are we?
  - A startup building a Python enterprise framework called Reflect.
  - Francois du Vignaud and a few of his friends and ex-colleagues have embarked in the Pytek project in November 2021. Their aim is to build the next generation software development tools for enterprise.

- - What do we mean by Python enterprise framework?
  - A solution that allows you to build professional web applications (aka web app) all in Python.
  - Reflect is a complete technical infrastructure which  allows developers to focus fully on delivering business functionality using state of the art tools in a rock solid environment.

- - What is a web app?
  - "A web page which allows for user interaction (eg: web mail, social network pages, etc)."
  - More specifically it is a web page which content heavily depends on the current context, be it user inputs, external events, etc. Reflect provides powerful abstractions making it easy to implement advanced dynamic behaviours, as well as external events processing (aka asynchronous programming).

- - Which applications is Reflect best suited to?
  - Reflect is very well suited for building business apps. Those can range from single user apps, to large scale systems such as website back-ends, B2B portals, business intelligence, automation,monitoring, reporting tools, etc.
  - Given it user-friendliness Reflect is very well suited for organizations with limited IT resources. Reflect allows any mildly Python experienced to build professional web apps.

- - What are Reflect's advantages over existing solutions?
  - Reflect is a turn key solution ready to be used by a developers of all levels.
  - "Equivalent technical infrastructures are not standardized. They usually comprise a JavaScript front end part and a back-end part written in a different language. Building and maintaining these such infrastructures is challenging and hardly relevant to the actual business needs. Comparable solutions exist on different platforms (eg: NodeJS, MS Blazor, Shiny). The ones available in Python have been build for rather specific use (eg: Plotly, Streamlit) "

- - What are Reflect limitations compared to existing solutions?
  - Reflect web apps work only in connected mode and use React UI components only.
  - The connected mode restriction means that Reflect is not suitable for use with unreliable or intermittent connections. React is by far the most popular UI framework in use nowadays. The only domain for which React is not suitable is highly bespoke user experiences such as games.


- - Are there any examples of apps build on top of Reflect yet?
  - You can see a few in the website app demos section, we will publish many more in the near future.
  - Our website and even this very presentation are build with Reflect. We eat our own dog food as they say in the Valley, and we love it! We are also building prototypes for a few startups already, some of them should be made public soon.

- - "What's in it for me?"
  - Become a Strategic Partner if you have a project which is a good fit and are committed to it. We will help you to make it a common success story.
  - Reflect is free to use for the time being. Strategic Partners (ie\:) will be able to keep using it for free indefinitely. Feel to reach out to us we will be more than happy to discuss with you whether Reflect is a good fit for your needs.

- - Can I use Reflect now?
  - You can play with the app demos on the website, download Reflect and start using it straightaway.
  - "Reflect is in beta, meaning we won't change its interface. We are aiming for the prod release mid year. We are also working hard on improving the tutorial, demos, so stay tuned."
