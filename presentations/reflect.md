# What functionality does Reflect provide?
Reflect can be used to serve either stand alone web apps or dynamic content embedded in existing webpages. In both cases users load a generic JavaScript client app that will be driven from a Python process on the server side.

# How does Reflect relates to No/Low Code solutions?
Reflect is a lower level framework in that it does not offer any pre-build functionality such database connectors, .

# What problem are we solving?

Systems development is a resource intensive and slow process for most companies at any scale.

Most common solutions are:

- MS Office hacking
Advanced users managed to automate part their workloads using VBA code, typically Excel spreadsheets shared across small teams. 
    - Pros: Very agile, user friendly, can often be developed by end users themselves, play well with the rest of the MS ecosystem.
    - Cons: Hardly scalable beyond a few users, limited to MS ecosystem

- Traditional web technologies
Web servers can generate content on demand (using Rest paradigm) providing modular functionalities (aka micro services).
    - Pros: Very easy to setup, functionalities can be split between different servers (aka micro-services).
    - Cons: Can only provide limited interactivity through classic page navigation.

- NodeJS, MS Blazor, R Shiny, etc
    - Pros: Powerful frameworks allowing to easily build and deploy a web apps.
    - Cons: Use less powerful or common programming languages than Python requiring specialized developers.

- Backend server + JavaScript client
    - Pros: Extremely flexible and powerful allows for truly interactive web apps.
    - Cons: Advanced setup requiring an ad hoc infrastructure.
    

What do we offer?

A user friendly yet powerful way to build web apps.

- Using Python which is arguably the best suited programming language for developing business apps nowadays.

- Using formulas which allows users to define dynamic behaviours naturally.

- Relying on a battled tested app framework allowing an easy maintenance and deployment.

What are the benefits?

- Anyone who knows Python can build professional web app. Those can range from single user applications to large scale systems.

- Maintenance and deployment are reduced to a minimum thanks to the built-in app server functionalities.

What are the benefits from a business point of view?

A massive productivity boost in software development. 

- Software development is dramatically more efficient (aka agile), allowing to build ad hoc solutions as you go with very few resources.

How does it integrate with existing systems?

- Reflect has been specifically designed to allow for a smooth adoption and integration. You can start building simple applications immediately, and migrate 


overlap with any part of existing systems. In particular it does not come with any database integration, user management, analytics, IDE, etc. This should allow to easily integrate it with your existing systems.
