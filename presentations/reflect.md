# What functionality does Reflect provide?
Reflect can be used to serve either stand alone web apps or dynamic content embedded in existing webpages. In both cases users load a generic JavaScript client app that will be driven from a Python process on the server side.

# How does Reflect relates to No/Low Code solutions?
Reflect is a lower level framework in that it does not offer any pre-build functionality such database connectors, .

# What problem are we solving?

Developing software is a resource intensive and slow process for non-tech companies. Most common solutions are:

- MS Office
    - Pros: Very agile, user friendly, can developed, maintained end users themselves
    - Cons: Hardly scalable beyond a couple of users, highly Microsoft tech dependant

- http web server
    - Pros: Very easy to setup, many great Python frameworks available
    - Cons: Not modular, not designed to support dynamic behaviour 

- NodeJS, MS Blazor, R Shiny, etc
    - Pros: Powerful frameworks allowing to easily build and deploy a variety of apps.
    - Cons: Use less powerful or common programming languages, requiring specialized developers to maintain.

- Python backend server + JavaScript client
    - Pros: Extremely flexible and powerful
    - Cons: Advanced setup requiring an ad hoc infrastructure 
    

What do we offer?

A user friendly yet powerful way to build web apps.

Easy to build because it uses arguably the best suited programming language for the task.

But also because it relies on formulas which
