`Tag` components can contain an `Icon`. This is done by setting the `icon` property or placing an `Icon` component within the `Tag`.

If you want specific control over the positioning and placement of the `Icon`, then that should be done by placing the `Icon` component within the `Tag` rather than using the `icon` property.
