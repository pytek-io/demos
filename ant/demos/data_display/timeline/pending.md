When the timeline is incomplete and ongoing, put a ghost node at last. Set `pending` as truthy value to enable displaying pending item. You can customize the pending content by passing a React Element. Meanwhile, `pendingDot={a React Element}` is used to customize the dot of the pending item. `reverse={true}` is used for reversing nodes.
